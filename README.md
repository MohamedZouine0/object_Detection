# This model is based on deep learning technology and computer vision
Create a data file and create images , labels and create val, test, train , and in each one create images and labels ,
outside the data path create another file called aug_data and repeate the same process from data on it,
open obeject_detection_detection.ipynb and start working ,
#when you collect images open labelme , and start selecting the area that you want to select (by ctrl+r , and for moving to the next pictures press D),and change output directory to images/labels ,
#after you finish selecting the area close labelme and place 70% of the pictures on train/images , 20% test/images and 10% val images and continue the work
